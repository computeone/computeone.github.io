**Physically based rendering or PBR** is a model in computer graphics
that seeks to render graphics in a way that more accurately models the
flow of light in the real world. Many PBR pipelines (though not all)
have the accurate simulation of photorealism as their goal, often in
real time computing.\
\
PBR is often characterized by - but not necessarily limited to - an
approximation of a real, radiometric bidirectional reflectance
distribution function to govern the essential reflections of light, the
use of reflection constants such as specular intensity, gloss, and
metallicity derived from measurements of real-world sources, accurate
modeling of global illumination in which light bounces and/or is emitted
from objects other than the primary light sources, conservation of
energy which balances the intensity of specular highlights with dark
areas of an object, Fresnel conditions that reflect light at the sides
of objects perpendicular to the viewer, and accurate modeling of
roughness resulting from microsurfaces.\
As described by researcher Jeff Russell of Marmoset, a physically based
rendering pipeline will focus on the following areas:\[2\]\
\
**Reflection\
Diffusion\
Translucency and transparency\
Conservation of energy\
Metallicity\
Fresnel reflectivity\
Microsurface scattering\\\\**
