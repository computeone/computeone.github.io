**Temporal Sample Anti-aliasing (TSAA)** seeks to reduce or remove the
effects of temporal aliasing. Temporal aliasing is caused by the
sampling rate (i.e. number of frames per second) of a scene being too
low compared to the transformation speed of objects inside of the scene;
this causes objects to appear to jump or appear at a location instead of
giving the impression of smoothly moving towards them. To avoid aliasing
artifacts altogether, the sampling rate of a scene must be at least
twice as high as the fastest moving object.\[1\] The shutter behavior of
the sampling system (typically a camera) strongly influences aliasing,
as the overall shape of the exposure over time determines the
band-limiting of the system before sampling, an important factor in
aliasing. A temporal anti-aliasing filter can be applied to a camera to
achieve better band-limiting.\[2\] A common example of temporal aliasing
in film is the appearance of vehicle wheels travelling backwards, the
so-called wagon-wheel effect. Temporal anti-aliasing can also help to
reduce jaggies, making images appear softer.\[3\]\
